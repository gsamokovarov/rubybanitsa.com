<h1>Ruby Banitsa</h1>

<p>
  Ruby Banitsa is an event filled with Ruby and Banitsa. We get
  together, nom some fresh and healthy Banitsa and talk about Ruby. We
  also do brain-sharing sessions. Some people call them presentations.
  Some call them other things.
</p>

<p>
  It's kind of like group therapy. But better, because there is
  Banitsa, ‚òïÔ∏è, üç∫ and Ruby.
</p>

<p>
  If you happen to be in Sofia, Bulgaria and like to talk about Ruby
  while having the munchies, please come hang out with us.
</p>

<p>Yum!</p>
