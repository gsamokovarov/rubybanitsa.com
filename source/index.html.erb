<h1>Ruby Banitsa</h1>

<p>
  Ruby Banitsa is an event filled with Ruby and Banitsa. We get
  together, nom some fresh and healthy banitsa and talk about ruby. We
  also do brain-sharing sessions. Some people call them presentations.
  Some call them other things.
</p>

<p>
  It's kind of like group therapy. But better, because there is
  banitsa, coffee, beer and ruby.
</p>

<p>
  If you happen to be in Sofia, Bulgaria and like to talk about Ruby
  while having the munchies, please come hang out with us.
</p>


<p>Yum!</p>

    This will be our very first Ruby Banitsa, so hello world, I guess. Come
    meet us that lovely Monday morning for a piece of banitsa and a quick
    presentation about scheduled tasks.
